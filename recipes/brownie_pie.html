        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                For the crust, combine flour, sugar, and teaspoon salt in a food processor 
                and pulse about 3 times until combined. Scatter cold butter over flour mixture 
                in food processor. Pulse about 6 times until butter resembles pea-sized pieces.
                Drizzle 3 tablespoons water over butter mixture. Pulse about 6 times until
                couscous-like beads of dough form, adding 1 more tablespoon ice water if needed. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Transfer dough to a work surface, and press into a single mass. Shape and flatten dough into a disk. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Wrap in plastic wrap, and chill for at least 1 hour or up to 2 days. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Unwrap dough and place on a lightly floured work surface.
                Let dough sit at room temperature for 10 minutes to soften. 
                Dust top of dough with flour. Using a lightly floured rolling pin, 
                roll disk into a 12-inch circle. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Place in a 9-inch pie plate, pressing into bottom and up
                sides of pie plate. Fold edges under, and crimp as desired. 
                Cover with plastic wrap, and freeze for 30 minutes. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). 
                Place parchment paper over dough in pie plate;
                fill with pie weights or dried beans. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven until crust is starting to set, about 15 minutes.  
            </li>
            <li>
                Carefully remove pie plate from oven and take off parchment paper
                and pie weights. Return pie plate to oven, and bake until pie crust
                is light golden brown, 8 to 12 minutes.  
            </li>
            <li>
                Transfer to a wire rack; let cool to room temperature, about 20 minutes. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Whisk together melted butter, sugar, eggs, egg yolk, canola oil, 
                and vanilla extract in a bowl until blended and smooth.
                Whisk in cocoa flour, instant espresso, and salt just until combined. 
                Stir in nuts and 1/4 cup chocolate chips.
            </li>
            <li>
                Scrape mixture into cooled crust, and smooth top with a small offset spatula. 
                Sprinkle remaining 1/4 cup chocolate chips on top of the pie. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted 
                in the center comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes,
                covering the crust with aluminum foil if it gets too dark.
                Let cool 20 minutes before serving.
